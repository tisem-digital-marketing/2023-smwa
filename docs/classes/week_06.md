## Lab Section


* Marketing Analytics in the Wild

> Suppose Instagram (owned by Meta) has launched a project to understand how they can earn additional revenue from influencer posts. Assume that at present Instagram does not charge an influencer or the company the influencer is hired by for a sponsored post. Propose an analysis strategy that could deliver a causal estimate of the effect of monetizing influencer posts for Instagram. In developing your presentation be sure to provide some strategic guidance on how they could scale this up and implement your solution across the whole platform. Are there any guardrail metrics they should track?
