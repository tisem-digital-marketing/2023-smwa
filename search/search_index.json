Sometimes your correction might actually be necessary, and it could still come off as annoying when you make it.  The best rule of thumb is, if you\u2019re not sure whether something needs to be said right now, hold off and see what happens.

Not everyone agrees on what constitutes a subtle -ism. Subtle -isms are baked into society in ways that can make them hard to recognize.

For example, please don\u2019t start a discussion about the latest offensive comment from Random Person Y.
